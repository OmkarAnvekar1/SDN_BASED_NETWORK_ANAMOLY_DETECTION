# SDN-Based Network Anomaly Detection

Welcome to the SDN-Based Network Anomaly Detection project! This system leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles to detect and mitigate network anomalies in real time, enhancing overall network security and performance.

## Network Topology
Here's the network topology created for this project. It lays the foundation for detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other anomalies.
